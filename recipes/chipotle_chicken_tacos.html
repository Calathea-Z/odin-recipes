    <h3>A complex yet simple dish of chicken thighs roasted in chipotle salsa</h3>
    <p> I learned this dish from a former colleague of mine while working in a Pizza joint of all places!<br>
        This spot had pretty good pizza but the real appeal were the stellar tacos. I love this recipe <br>
        because it is simple but so damn tasty! </p>
